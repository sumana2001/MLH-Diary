# Inspiration :bulb:

This application was inspired by the MLH Orientation Hack organized by the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source) 2022 Spring Batch. The [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.is/) Team of three(3) came up with an idea to build this application called [Github Stars](https://mlh-orientation-hack.vercel.app/) during a four(4) days Hackathon.
The Team saw the need to build an application that many Github users will find useful, beneficial and fun to use. <br>

# What is it:question:
Github Stars is a software application that allows Github Users enter their Github repository link and see the Profile Picture(s) and name(s) of the number of Github Users that have starred their projects. The Github Stars application was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Github Graphql API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).

## Prerequisites :technologist:

### Install The `create-next-app` Package
Open your Terminal to install the `create-next-app` npm package globally on your local machine. The `create-next-app` package enables you to run the project and build the source files. To install the `create-next-app` package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g create-next-app
```
## Steps for Cloning and Running the Application locally :footprints: :footprints:

- **Clone the project**: <br>
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumana2001/mlh-orientation-hack.git
```
- **Install all the packages**: <br>
After cloning the project, it should be saved in your Local Machine. Next, Open your terminal and `cd` (Change Directory) into the project's directory in your Local Machine. Then, type the following command to install all the packages needed for the application to run:

```bash
yarn install
```
**Run the development server**
Use the following command to run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
## How We Built Github Stars :smiley:
We used Next.js as the Frontend Framwework of our web application and we used Typescript. We also used Github Graphql API in place of REST API to learn more about the GraphQL ecosystem and technology. Then, we made use of Apollo Client as the library to enable us easily interact with Github GraphQL API. We had to obtain a Github access to make use of the Github GraphQL API. 

## Technologies Used :hammer_and_pick:
- [ ] Nextjs 
- [ ] Typescript
- [ ] Github GraphQL API
- [ ] Apollo Client
