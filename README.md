# Inspiration :bulb:

This application was inspired by the MLH Orientation Hack organized by the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source) 2022 Spring Batch. The [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.is/) Team of three(3) came up with an idea to build this application called [Github Stars](https://mlh-orientation-hack.vercel.app/) during a four(4) days Hackathon.
The Team saw the need to build an application that many Github users will find useful, beneficial and fun to use. <br>

# What is it:question:
Github Stars is a software application that allows Github Users enter their Github repository link and see the Profile Picture(s) and name(s) of the number of Github Users that have starred their projects. The Github Stars application was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Github Graphql API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).
